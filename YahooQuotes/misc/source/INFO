order_data_vars.py: reads `datavarlist.txt' and creates a python dict.
build_lists.sh: generates additional lists (Complete, Basic and Real-Time)

I was able to build a list of unique data info variables along with their descriptions using:

```
    grep '<option value="' edit_pfview.htm  | \
    sed -e 's/&amp;//g' -e 's/<\/option><option value="//g' \
    -e 's/">/ /g' | sort -u | grep ^[a-z] 
'''
